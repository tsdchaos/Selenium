What are Web Elements?
    - Basically anything you see on a web page
What are locators?
    - It is the tags that mark the location of the web elements
    - there are 8 types of locators


***********XPATH*******************
Why do we need XPath locator?
    - Developers may not have provided other locators in the html
    - By using xpath, we can identify those web elements easily

What is an xpath?
    - XPath is just like a query language that helps you to identify elements
    - Query languages are used to "query" or find something in your databases

Types of Xpath:
1. Absolute XPath
--> starts with a starting node in html
it starts with a single slash
e.g. //html/body/div/div[2]/div/div/div/div/div[2]/div/div/form/div[2]/button
2. Relative XPath
Syntax:
starts with //tagname[@attribute='attribute value']

Example:
//input[@type='password']
hey, can you find me the tag input who has an attribute "type" with the attribute value "password"

identify the element by its text:
//tagname[text()='text value']
Can you find me the tag a which has text

identifying elements using contain method
//tagname[contains(@attribute,'attribute value')]
hey, can you find me the tag which contains the attribute _________

The Advance XPath:
