Window Handles (Continued)
WindowHandles():
    - Unique ID associated with each new window/tab
How do we handle multiple windows in selenium?
    1) getWindowHandles() --> gets all the handles -- return type: set of Strings
    2) driver.switchTo.window(desired windowHandle);
    getWindowHandles() --> this method is not taking care of maintaining the order in which tabs were opened
Typically, only 1 window or tab at a time is maintained


****************waits*******************
1) ImplicitWait
    -implicit wait is applied to all "driver.findElement"
    If the element is found, no wait is applied
    if the element is not found, then the wait is applied for a certain amount of time
    *If the certain amount of time has passed and still the element is not found, we get an Exception
        *NoSuchElement*
    Syntax for this wait:
        driver.manage().timeouts().implicitWait(time, units);
            implicitWait(maximum amount of time before it throws an exception, units)
    **impicit wait--> waits till the WebElement is found
    2. ExplicitWait or WebDriver waits
        these waits are used to tell the webDriver to wait till the certain condition is matched
