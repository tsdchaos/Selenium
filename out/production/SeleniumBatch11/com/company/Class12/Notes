1. POM -- Page Object Model
is a design pattern which allows us to enhance test maintainance and reduce code duplication + improve readibility

Advantages:
    1. Code reusability
    2. Code maintainability
    3. Readability

PageFactory:
    A class in Selenium that helps us find the elements

public WebElement username=driver.findElement(By.xpath("fjdsljfklds");
instead we use this:
    @FindBy(xpath"fjdsljfklds")
    public WebElement username;

1 more extra thing if you are using page factory
You need to initialize your variables
    public loginWithPageFactory(){
        PageFactory.initElements(driver, this);
    }
    The above needs to ALWAYS be done, no matter what page you are using PageFactory on
