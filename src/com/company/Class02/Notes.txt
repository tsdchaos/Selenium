Recap:
What is Selenium?
    - A set of tools that help us to automate webbased applications only
    - No desktop application can be automated using Selenium
    - functional testing is done using Selenium

COmponents of Selenium Suite
    1. Selenium IDE, RC, Webdriver, Grid
Selenium 3 has combined webdriver and RC

Advantages:
1. open source
2. works with different programming languages and browsers
3. Not OS dependent

Disadvantages:
1. No support
2. No built in reports
3. No desktop application testing


Webdriver: It's an interface

Steps to open chrome using Selenium
    1. Set System Properties (key, value)
    key is the driver we are using
    value is the path to the driver
    2. Create an object of ChromeDriver()
    3. Use method .get() and pass the url of the website that you want to launch


    --difference in quit()--> quits the whole browser vs close()--> is going to close the current tab
    --navigate() vs get()--> using navigate(), we can move forwards, backwards, and refresh. Cannot do this with get()

    --fullscreen() and maximize() --methods to maximize and fullscreen the window


------------------HTML-------------

<html> these are tags
    <body>
        <input name="Alan"> //this tag does not require a closing tag. (name is the attribute, Alan is the value of the attribute
    </body>
</html>
the webpage has an underlying html code
--everything that we see on a webpage is basically appearing to us  through some kind of code
DOM--> Document Object Model

Web Element:
everything that appears on the webpage is called a webelement

Locator:
It is the address or the position of the WebElement on the page

8 locators:
1. id
2. Name
3. TagName
4. classname
5. linktext
6. partiallinktext
7. xpath
8. css


A webelement have an underlying code
this html code starts with a tag
the tag may have different attributes
these attributes are there to help locate those elements
and in some cases, define the other criterias

We must make sure that the locator that we are opting for is unique enough
What if there are two same attribute with the same values?
--Selenium will return the first one it finds in the code
