Frames:
Identify the iFrame:
    1) Right click and see if you see view frame source. If so, it means it is an iFrame
    2) use //iframe when inspecting the code, and it will show all the iFrames available
        Example:
            <html>
                <body>
                    <iframe>
                        <html>
                            <body>
                            </body>
                        </html>
                    </iframe>
                </body>
            </html>

Before interacting with frames, we need to tell our driver to switch to the desired frame

There are three ways to interact with frames:
    1) By index -->driver.switchTo().frame(int index)--> the index on which our iframe lies
    2) By name or ID -->driver.switchTo().frame(String ID or Name)--> only id or name can be used
    3) by WebElement --> driver.switchTo().frame(WebElement) --pass in the WebElement i.e. the desired frame

defaultContent()--> switch the focus back to the main page
in alerts--> no need to switch back focus
in frames--> we have to switch our focus back to home page

****************Authentication Alerts*******************
Authentication alerts: we need to give user name and password
in order to handle them, we need to pass the parameters (i.e. username and password) in the url

How do you handle alerts in Selenium?
By switching to the alert from the main page

*******************Windows Handles**********************
Selenium treats tabs and windows almost the same
WindowHandle:
    a uniqueID, the address of that window
    it is 40 characters alphanumeric

Handling Windows in Selenium:
    In order to handle them, we will be using methods:
        1) getWindowHandle(); --> give the address of the current window that Selenium is focusing on
        2) getWindowHandles(); --> gives the addressed of all the windows
To switch to a particular window
driver.switchTo.window(Handle of the Desired Window)
