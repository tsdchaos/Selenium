What is Software Testing?
    - The process to identify the quality, correctness, and completeness of developed computer software

How many ways can we test a software?
    - Manual
    - Automation

When do we go for automation?
    - When frequent regression testing is required
    - When repeated test case execution is required
    - efficiency

What are the tools that we have for automation?
    - Selenium
    - UFT/QTP
    - Cucumber
    - TestNG
    - Katalon Studio

Levels of Testing?
    - Unit testing
    - Integration testing
    - System testing
    - Acceptance testing

Types of testing?
    - Functional testing
    - Non-functional testing (performance, security)

What is Selenium?
    - A set of tools that help us to automate webbased applications only
    - It is usually used for performance testing

Selenium suite...
    1. Selenium IDE --> it is a plugin, record and play
        cons: no programming

    2. Selenium RC(Remote Control)
        - Supports different languages
        - it supports different browsers
        - It requires a rc server

    3. Selenium Webdriver
        - Supports different browsers
        - It will support different programming languages

    4. Selenium Grid
        - consists of a node and a hub
        - run test cases in parallel on different browsers

Selenium 1
Selenium 2--> Selenium RC and Webdriver combined
Selenium 3--> made improvements to Selenium 2
Selenium 4--> brand new, some changes and improvements in the communication protocols

Advantages of Selenium:
    - Open Source!!
    - Compatible with different languages (Java, ruby, C#)
    - it allows you to have your test cases run on different browsers
    - It is not OS dependant (Windows, MAC, Linux)
Disadvantages of Selenium:
    - No technical support, as it is Open Source
    -  We can not test desktop applications
    - no built in reports
    - Cannot test captchas, images and videos

Selenium Architecture:
--------Close vs Quit---------
driver.close() --> it will close the current tab that we are on
driver.quit()--> it will close the whole browser

-------get() vs navigate()
-- using navigate we can move forward, backward, and refresh the page
--Using get(), we cannot do that


All webpages are made of usually HTML, CSS, and js
we have tags in
