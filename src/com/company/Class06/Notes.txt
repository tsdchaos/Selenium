Drop Down
What is a Drop Down?
    - It is a WebElement, just like links, radio buttons, text boxes, etc.
    - It allows us to select from a dropdown menu that appears on the screen
    - Two Type:
        1) Single Select
        2) Multi-Select
    Two Methods to handle drop downs:
        1) Click on the drop down and then Select the option
        2) Use Select Class
            Condition: <select> tag is there in the drop down
            //If the <select> tag is not there, we cannot use Select class

    Select class is a class available to us in selenium, which has different methods that help us to handle the drop downs

    Steps to use Select Class:
        1) Find the WebElement "dropdown" having the select class
        2) Create an object of Select Class(webElement(which has the select tag))
        3) Use any method provided by Select class to select the option you desire
            a) .ByValue() --> parameter: the value attribute "value" in <options> tag
            b) .ByIndex()--> parameter: the iondex of the option that you want to select
            c) .ByVisibleText() --> parameter: the text in the tag <option> that we want to select
        4) .getOptions()--> no parameter: returns us all the tags <options> which are child of <Select> tag

Multiple Select drop down
    1) isMultiple()--> if the drop down is multiselect or not (Boolean)
    Additional Methods
        a) deselectbyIndex();
        b) deselectbyValue();
        c) deselectbyVisibleText();
        d) deselectAll();
    exception:
        No such element exception --> the WebElement you are looking for is not there on the page


Alerts:
    An alert is a pop up message, or takes the focus completely off the page
    We cannot proceed in selenium until it is handled

    3 Types of Alerts:
        1) Web based alerts --> it is an html based alert / we can resolve them simply by inspecting
        2) Javascript alerts/browser alerts --> We cannot handle them by inspecting, since they don't have HTML.
           We handle them by using switchTo method in selenium
        3) Window based alerts --> We cannot handle them with Selenium

    Javascript alerts:
    3 Types
        1) Simple Alert --> Click ok, and it is done
        2) Confirmation Alert --> Either cancel or Ok
        3) Prompt Alert --> enter text and cancel or ok

    How to handle these javascript alerts in Selenium
    Using "alert interface"

    The methods it gives us:
    1) accept();
    2) dismiss();
    3 getText();
