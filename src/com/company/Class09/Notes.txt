Selenium Waits:
    1) Why to avoid Thread.sleep()??
        a) EXAMPLE:
            <button> that takes 5 seconds to appear-->
                --thread.sleep(1000);
                --findElement statement
    Implicit wait:
    Will be applied to all the FindElement(). We can use these waits to "wait" and find those elements which are not yet
    there in the DOM, for a specific threshold before we throw an Exception

    Explicit wait or Webdriver wait:
    Go to the website
    click on the "Enable button after 10 seconds"
    Once the button is enabled, print the state of the button


    WEBTABLES:
        Webtables are elements on the webpage that have rows and columns.

        Type:
            1) Static WebTables
            2) Dynamic WebTables
